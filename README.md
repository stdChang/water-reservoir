<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This project was developed over the course of weeks as a final for the ECS 162 Web Programming Course at UC Davis. At the time of Spring 2022, it was taught by Professor Nina Amenta and she did mention it to be one of the last times she would be handling the course. It was a pleasure to learn the basics from her and she was very accommodating during a difficult time when the pandemic just began easing down. 

Built alongside Ishan Singh and eventually Sohum Goel, we constructed each part of this in stages. This ensured that each component was functional at minimum before deployment and granted time for input from TAs to improve the quality with each sprint. One of the most difficult tasks with this project was to fully connect the frontend and backend to properly communicate in an asynchronous format. Our understanding of components grew better over time as we fixed flickering and redundant rendering as a symptom of our React code.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Purpose
Civil Engineers interested in the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC) can observe the capacity and water levels of California's reservoirs. This information is vital and predicting trends can have an impact not only on daily life for citizens, but could point to larger-scale problems within the management of our government spending/regulation of water resources. Warnings of such problems allow people to understand the risk of situations such as the Palisade and Eaton Canyon fires and give citizens a heads-up before similar repeat disasters strike.

## Usage

Engineers can set a specific month to observe various data collected from reservoirs. The calendar widget goes from 2020 up to the current year.
